# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This project is a classic two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple yet engaging game where two players take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
